# Millipore Notes
* l33 n5 Field labels could be a huge miss if the api is not set up or complete
* image carousel --- i mean it is a carousel so its probably not working well
* search is far away from designs
* translation from ux to fe. Large UX stories more granular fe tickets
* alerts modals and spinner are the most out of sync. between material and custom
* chrome alert even though already on chrome.
