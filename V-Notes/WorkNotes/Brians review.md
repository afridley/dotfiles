Brian has been an exceptional leader on this project. Not only in the code aspect but in other aspects that are even more important to the projects success. I have seen Brian notice and help when individuals may have low morale, where most other lead devs probably wouldn't have noticed. 

Brian also has a great knowledge of both front end and Drupal and is able to help out on both fronts.

But probably the thing that makes him the most valuable dev on this project is his friendship with the new Product owner. Which has really helped point and guide this project in the right direction and has helped cut through some of the bureaucracy that would have otherwise held us up.

Brian is both a great leader and a honest and wise advisor as well as many other hats. And he is doing an exceptional job at all of them.
