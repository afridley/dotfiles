# 1. Clone
First step is to use git to clone the project onto your machine.

# 2. Node.js 
## Installing Node
You will first need to install node.js as this is what React and Next use.

We use the LTS version of node.
this can be downloaded here [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once node is installed you should be able to open your cli and type

`node -v`
and
`npm -v`

Both of those should give you different versions.

Node is the server structure on which the frontend runs.

npm is the package manger that downloads packages for node.

## Installing yarn
Our project uses yarn as a substitute for npm.

You can install yarn by running

`npm i -g yarn`

This will install yarn globally (to your user rather then just in the project)

once you install yarn run

`yarn -v` to make sure it is working.

# 2. Installing the project.
Now that yarn is installed you can open a terminal in the root directory of the project

simply run `yarn` in the root directory of the project and it will install all the packages that the project uses.

## 3. Running the project
Once the project is installed you may run
```
yarn dev
```

This will run the project in develop mode. where you will be able to see the site locally at http://localhost:3000

Also please check the scripts section of the package.json file for other scripts that you can run.

## 4. Changing local setup
By default the local setup uses the dev api. So if you are not on the VPN you may be blocked from making api calls. You will also be blocked from logging in.

These settings can be found in the .env.development file.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API is the variable that tells the FE what api baseUrl to use. currently there are 3 options only one of which is commented in
* One for the unloadbalanced dev
* One for dev
* And one if you are hosting a local BE

To run it against your local BE you will need to uncomment the localhost:5000 option and recomment your selected one so that only one NEXT_PUBLIC_API is active (it will just use the last one defined if more then one are uncommented or exist).

The other env variables have to do with:
MCC variables are being used with AzureAd b2c login. These are used int the msal.ts file

The CMS variables are used to make a connection and call the CMS. These are used in the coaches pages and coaches api routes.

# Included for additional information Next js project primer
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
