We auto generate our api handler and then create an instance of it.

There are 2 scripts that can be run with
```
yarn generate
```

```
yarn generateLocal
```

If we look at these scripts where they are defined in the package.json file we will see

```json
{
    "generate": "swagger-typescript-api -p  https://dev.api.mentalhealthadvisor.mayoclinic.org/swagger/v1/swagger.json -o ./src/apiClient --modular --axios",
    "generateLocal": "npx swagger-typescript-api -p  http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json -o ./src/apiClient --modular --axios",
}
```

So generate will target dev `https://dev.api.mentalhealthadvisor.mayoclinic.org/swagger/v1/swagger.json`

And generateLocal will target `http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json`

It is targeting the openApi file known as the swagger.json file.
As long as your local machine is connected to the vpn and can also access those urls the cli command will look at that api document and generate the api and its types.

> THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IF THERE ARE NEW ENDPOINTS CREATED.

> Note: if types are not defined correctly on the .Net api side then you may get build errors. It is ok to change the generated types but better to Change the BE .Net project to have the correct documentation and thus generate the correct types.

To use the new api in your project you will import the API class instance using

```ts
const { api } = API
```

where API is imported

so a sample file would look like

```ts
import { API } from 'api/api'
import localeList from 'common/localeList'
import { GetStaticProps, NextPage } from 'next'
import { serverSideTranslations } from 'next-i18next/serverSideTranslations'
import Head from 'next/head'
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

const Example: NextPage = () => {
  const { api } = API
  const [dependentId, setDependentId] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    api.coachesList().then((res) => setDependentId(res.data[0].dependantId || ''))
  }, [api])

  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Example</title>
      </Head>
      {/* will show   */}
      {dependentId}
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => ({
  props: {
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    ...await serverSideTranslations(locale!, localeList),
  },
})

export default Example
```

* We can see above how the API is imported.
* Then we use the api object from in API.
* Finally we use api in the `useEffect()` which will reload if api changes. 
It will make an api call to coaches list then set dependentId to the first index's dependent id. If there is no dependentId in the first index it will just set it to ''.

We will then output that to the page below
`{dependentId}`
