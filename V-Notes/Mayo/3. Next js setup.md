We have made a few important changes to the next.config.js, which is a configuration file that helps you setup how your project functions and its structure

Our config looks like

```ts
const nextConfig = {
  i18n,
  reactStrictMode: true,
  distDir: 'build',
  pageExtensions: ['page.tsx', 'api.ts'],
  webpack(config) {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.svg$/i,
      issuer: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
      use: ['@svgr/webpack'],
    })

    return config
  },
}
```

`distDir: 'build',` Means that instead of the default /.next folder our build outputs will go to /build. If you see the /.next folder talked about in the next docs know that for us it is /build

`pageExtensions: ['page.tsx', 'api.ts'],` This allows us to put folders inside the pages directory to better organize the project. If you need to create a new page that you want to render it must have the .page.tsx extension.

If you want a new api route you must use the .api.ts extension. All other extensions will not be picked up by next as pages or api routes. 

If this sounds a bit confusing there should be a video made during the handoff that covers this. Or you can read the Next.js docs to better understand how next folder structures work.
